## Findings and Conclusions
In this project, I analyzed Domino's pizza sales data using MySQL to solve important business question related to orders, revenue, pizza categories, and customer preferences. I identified how many orders were placed each month and noticed weekend days(Saturday & Sunday) contributed higher order volum, showing customers prefer pizza more during weekends. 
I also found the top 5 best-selling pizzas, helping the business understand which products drive the highest demand. Revenue analysis highlighted which months generated the highest income, allowing Dominos's to focus more promotional activities during peak-performing months. Additionally, I examind the most popular pizza sizes and pizzas containing "Chicken" to understand specific customer taste preferences. 
Overall, This analysis helps Domino's make better business decisions such as improving stock management, designing targeted weekend offers, focusing on best-selling categories, and optimizing menu strategies to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.
